            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h4>Technical Analysis Image Classification - Python/Keras</h4>
            <p>Created a machine learning model that scanned images of stock charts for the “cup and handle” technical analysis pattern. Utilized Keras and other Python APIs to download images of stock charts and run image classification algorithms on this dataset</p>
            <h4>Net Liquidity Notebook - Python/Jupyter</h4>
            <p>Designed a Juptyer notebook to measure the aggregate liquidity of Federal Reserve facilities and compare this quantity to daily equity markets. </p>
            <h4>Markov - Java</h4>
            <p> Engineered a Markov word processor program that could learn from a given sample text file and generate matching text based on patterns of letters and words.</p>
            <h4>Message Board - C/C++</h4>
            <p>Soldered an Arduino microcontroller to an E-ink display and coded a program that would utilize any local wireless network to connect to a cloud server and print the message stored in the server. Utilized as a method of long distance communication as the server could be updated in real time worldwide.</p>
